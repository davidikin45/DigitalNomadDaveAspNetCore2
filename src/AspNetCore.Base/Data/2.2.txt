--Collections of owned entities

Owned types = Complex Types

if you can’t make a value object immutable, then it is not a value object.

A simpler version of that technique is to compare a value object to an integer. Do you really care if the integer 5 is the same 5 that you used in another method? Definitely not, all fives in your application are the same regardless of how they were instantiated. That makes an integer essentially a value object. Now, ask yourself, is this notion in your domain looks like integer? If the answer is yes, then it’s a value object.

You care about what they are, not who they are. Examples include numbers and strings, but can also be higher-level concepts like groups of attributes.

EF Core 2.0 added the ability to model ownership in one-to-one associations. EF Core 2.2 extends the ability to express ownership to one-to-many associations. Ownership helps constrain how entities are used.
For example, owned entities: – Can only ever appear on navigation properties of other entity types. – Are automatically loaded, and can only be tracked by a DbContext alongside their owner.
In relational databases, owned collections are mapped to separate tables from the owner, just like regular one-to-many associations. But in document-oriented databases, we plan to nest owned entities (in owned collections or references) within the same document as the owner.
You can use the feature by calling the new OwnsMany() API:
modelBuilder.Entity<Customer>().OwnsMany(c => c.Addresses);

By convention, EF Core will name the database columns for the properties of the owned entity type following the pattern Navigation_OwnedEntityProperty. Therefore the StreetAddress properties will appear in the 'Orders' table with the names 'ShippingAddress_Street' and 'ShippingAddress_City'.

--Spatial data support
Spatial data can be used to represent the physical location and shape of objects. Many databases can natively store, index, and query spatial data. Common scenarios include querying for objects within a given distance, and testing if a polygon contains a given location. EF Core 2.2 now supports working with spatial data from various databases using types from the NetTopologySuite (NTS) library.
Spatial data support is implemented as a series of provider-specific extension packages. Each of these packages contributes mappings for NTS types and methods, and the corresponding spatial types and functions in the database. Such provider extensions are now available for SQL Server, SQLite, and PostgreSQL (from the Npgsql project). Spatial types can be used directly with the EF Core in-memory provider without additional extensions.
Once the provider extension is installed, you can add properties of supported types to your entities. For example:
using NetTopologySuite.Geometries;

namespace MyApp
{
  public class Friend
  {
    [Key]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    [Required]
    public Point Location { get; set; }
  }
}

Installing
In order to use spatial data with EF Core, you need to install the appropriate supporting NuGet package. Which package you need to install depends on the provider you're using.
